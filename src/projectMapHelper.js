Memes have influenced modern culture, showcase the news, and bring joy to billions of people around the world. I want to share that joy with the next to me by creating the world's first meme-multi connect soundboard. This meme soundboard allows users to connect to one server, and share the pre-loaded meme sounds with other people who have this application. \nI implemented this meme soundboard with .NET, C#, and WPF. I created my own http servers and created the custom wpf boards. These boards are able to connect to my http server and we are able to see which meme sound a user plays, and able to tell other sound boards to play the same sound."

As a enthusiast I wanted to find a way to display my memes stored on my computer, also I wanted a way to track the memes stored and the locations they are in, that is why I designed my own personal file tracker, and then share this joy with the world. \n I implemented this file tracking system with .NET, MSSQL, C#, jQuery, Dapper ORM, and jQuery Isotope. I designed the database, wrote the controllers, and designed the front end of the application."

It seems that to be eligible for an entry-level software developer position, you need at least 5 years of senior developer experience, and the fact recruiters go through hundreds of resumes every day makes the process so much more complicated. Well look no further. My friend Adams is one of the best full-stack developer. We have worked together on so many applications, and I want to help him in any way, so I built him this website to get more recognition. \n I implemented this website with Node.js, Vue.js, Vuetify, and Google Firestore.
